In the real world, participants attend events, engage in real-world activities like geocaching, scavenger hunts, and artistic/musical events, win prizes, and most importantly, modify their energy-related behaviors. In the virtual world of the Kukui Cup web application, participants earn points, achieve badges, increase their energy literacy through readings and videos, and use social networking mechanisms to engage with friends about the event. Our hope is that this combination of real and virtual activities complement and reinforce each other. The blending of real and virtual worlds has been explored in other \"serious games\" such as Urgent/Evoke.",

This data will help us to understand more about the strengths and weaknesses of our approach. \r\n\r\nPrivacy\r\nNo identifying information about you will be made available in any research publications resulting from this study.\r\n\r\nNote that as part of your participation in the competition, information such as your \"public commitments\" will be made available to others via mechanisms such as the Kukui Cup \"wall\" in your home page. If you choose to enable Facebook integration, then public commitments and activities will be transmitted to Facebook. However, such identifying information will not be made available in future research publications.\r\nIf you do not wish to participate\r\nYour participation in this study is voluntary.

To set a conservation goal, start by going to the Go Low page by clicking on the energy meter icon at the top of this page. Once there, find out your lounge's current consumption for today and see if it's above or below the goal. Then do whatever you can personally to minimize your energy consumption for the remainder of today, and encourage your lounge mates to do the same. See the Go Low page for suggestions on what to do. If you're successful, your lounge will have used less energy than the goal by midnight tonight, and everyone in your lounge will get awarded Kukui Cup points! ",
