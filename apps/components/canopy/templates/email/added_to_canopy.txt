Congratulations on your success in the {{ competition_name }}! You are now part of
an exclusive group eligible to access a new part of the {{ competition_name }}
website called the Canopy. The Canopy is a different type of {{ competition_name }}
experience, focused on more in-depth investigations of energy data and
discussion between members. You will find Canopy Missions to complete,
some which are done solo, others require you to work in a group of 2-3
Canopy members.

To keep things fair for the folks not in the Canopy, your activities
in the Canopy earn you Canopy Karma rather than normal {{ competition_name }}
points. But just to keep things interesting, we're going to give away
a $25 UH Bookstore gift certificate to the Canopy member who has the
most Karma at the end of the competition.

You can continue to access and participate in the other parts of the
{{ competition_name }} website that you have already experienced, including earning
more points there.

How do you get up there? Just log in and take a look "above you"!

Welcome to the Canopy!
